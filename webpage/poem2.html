                In the blue oceans' depth,<br>
                A melodious song can be heard,<br>
                The song that whales sing,<br>
                Letting others know they are not alone<br>
                Isn't it fascinating how they can hear each other?<br>
                Despite the loneliness and untouched depths.<br>
                And isn't it fascinating that you can't hear my screams and cries?
